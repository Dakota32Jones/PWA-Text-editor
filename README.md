# <Text-Editor>

## Description

The purpose of this application is to follow PWA criteria to install an application offline. The application should persist the data from the last saved point when you exited the browser. The application should be able to cache images as well to bundle the javascript. Through this I learned how to create a webpack config to compile javascript and css and more.
